                    <br>
                    <p>If you’re lucky, I’ll even throw in a little Animation!</p>

                    <p>A designer who can also write has to be pretty special too, right? No? Oh.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Come see why Kotaku publishes my work (Yes, they read it) and why Medium hasn’t banned me yet.</p>

                    <p>When I was 12 I discovered you could use photoshop to put myself in Lord of the Rings. This seemed like a perfectly good reason to become a designer, so after a short 10-ish years, I did.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>But don’t worry, that’s just the tip of this incredibly long-winded iceberg. Want to know more about me? Well, you’re just one click away...</p>
