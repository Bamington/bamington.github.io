                <p>Created for the 2018 Global Game Jam over the course of <b>three days</b>, Romance Protocol is a riff on the dating simulator genre. The player meets various robots in a post-apolocolyptic setting, and then chooses which robots they've met best simulate human emotion. You can see a description of the setting below:</p>
                <br>
            <i>
                <p>2000 years have passed since a virus wiped out mankind.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Robots everywhere watched their families, workplaces, and responsibilities disappear around them. The remaining bots desperately try to find and replicate what they can of human data.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Hoping to create a sense of purpose once more, slowly but surely their protocol is corrupted. Odd sentence strings, incoherent replies, and damaged code - these bots are the outliers of the digital society.</p>
                <br>
                <p>You are a DetectoBot-2718. As the neural network becomes increasingly corrupted, more and more bots are transmitting incorrect and potentially dangerous code. It's your role to travel between DetectoBot hosts and identify which bots are going against their regular programming - and terminate those who are infected. In order to stay undercover, you must spend time with these bots in classic humanoid first date locations and 'get to know them' before reporting back.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Get it wrong, and you might just be terminated yourself.</p>
                <br>

            <h3>The User Interface</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Romance Protocol is, essentially, a game based around conversations. Because of this, I wanted to create a messenger-style diegetic UI that would allow us to display a conversation log the user could scroll though</p>
            <br>
            <p>The ability to browse the conversation after it's been had was of particular importance, as the user was looking for clues during the conversations.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="img/rpimg_01.png">
            <p class="caption">The first draft of the UI was a very, very simple set of text boxes.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It was important that the player understood who was talking. As each of our robots had a signature color, we used that in the text box design to maintain clarity.</p>
